# Life of conscious choice(s)

There is always something going on, it's just a matter of where exactly do you direct your attention to; then everything is communicating: the trees, the mushrooms, the bugs, the birds; everything communicates, speaks, sings, makes music and everything is recorded into energy. If you stop and learn how to be present in this very moment now and here, here and now and learn to listen and understand what’s going on in the world around you, you’ll see everything through the eyes of the universe. 

All in life is happening for you, happens for you and will happen for you - you just need to appreciate it.

We can choose the lives we want to live and in what shape, form and / or being. 

We can decide to live one of our lives as a tree or as a fish or a bird or as a bug or as a ant. 
We can change as many times as we want to. And sometimes some of us decide to live life as only one form of being.

 We literally are all interconnected. 

To form a mountain many beings are needed and these beings form a mountain. 

Sometimes one (or several) of the beings “breaks away” from the mountain and it has an effect on the mountain and the surroundings. The same applies to the seas and the oceans. 

Our whole planet is a living being, comprised of many various individual beings and together we create harmony and live in it.

  

Q: How much time do you take for decision making?

A: All the time we need - all the time of eternity. 


  
Life as is. 


*******************

Peijin, Jon, Nick Amalia, Olga and Ya Sha. 


We are the ones of the few, who were not corrected and screened during the conception and our genes were not manipulated and / or improved. We are the children of the natural conception and natural pregnancy by our biological mothers. 

We are not so called designed children. 

Did I want to change? I don't know anymore. I don't think so. I know that I'm unique as I am and I celebrate my uniqueness and I'm sure that Peijin also does that. 

"Yes, I do" confirmed Peijin.

There is no longer fear of the different on the Earth. There are many different life forms on Earth nowadays. Natural beings, artificially created beings, cyborgs, robots, etc and we all live in peace loving and appreciating each other. 

We celebrate "things", we celebrate uniqueness, we celebrate similarity, we celebrate being alive, WE CELEBRATE. 

Should I want to change the way I look I can do that. Thankfully the technologies allow us to do that. 

"Do you want to change Ya (Sha)?" asked Nick. 

"I haven't decided yet. I'm still gathering information and I'm also starting to try things out."

"Do you enjoy being you?"

Yes, I do. I enjoy being me as I am now and my brother decided to live the live in the form he has chosen.

Can he change the form, whenever he wants to? 

Of course he can. We can be whatever / whoever we want to be and we don't need any technical devices for that. 

"Where is he now?"

"He is here." and she made a gesture encompassing all space around them.

How about travelling? 

Oh, we can travel, too, however we usually don't do that. We have everything we need on our planet and we can transfer ourselves to any location we want to on our planet or onto any other planet of our choice. We just need to "see" where we want to "go" and we "go" there.

Nick: "Ya Sha, where's Kho Pa? We wanted to see him again."
Ya Sha: smiles gently "He is here."
Olga: looking around, concerned "Where? I don't see him."
Ya Sha: gestures encompassing all the space around them "He is here. Everywhere."
Peijin: voice catching "Did he... did he die?"
Ya Sha: "No, not at all. He just changed his form." still smiling
Chen: "???" exchanges confused looks with others
Jon: trying to understand "Changed his form into... what?"
Ya Sha: "Into everything. He wanted to experience being everywhere at once. So he chose that."
Long silence. Crew struggling to comprehend.
Olga: "You mean the Kho Pa we met - the small, fluffy one - is now...?"
Ya Sha: "Yes. The air you're breathing. The ground beneath you. The space between us. All of it. He is all of it now."
Nick: to crew, quietly "This is... this is actually possible?"
An Var: joins them "Of course! Kho Pa wanted different experiences. Being small and contained was beautiful for a time. Now he wants to know what it feels like to be unbounded."
Peijin: "Can he still... think? Feel? Know we're here?"
Ya Sha: "Of course. Would you like to speak with him?"
The crew exchanges uncertain glances.

Ya Sha: "Of course. But to speak with you, he would need your allowance to enter your consciousness - that's the only way he can communicate with you now. Though he absolutely experiences you and sees you even in this very moment."
Chen: processing "So he can perceive us, but can't talk to us unless we... give permission?"
Ya Sha: "Yes. Entering your mind without permission would be violence, even now. Even though he is everywhere."
Jon: quietly awed "He's everywhere, omnipresent, and still respects our boundaries..."
Olga: "I... I'd like to speak with him. If that's okay. How do I give permission?"
Ya Sha: "Just say yes. He can hear you."
Olga: looking around at the air, the ground, everything "Kho Pa, yes. You can... you can enter my consciousness. I want to hear you."
Pause. Olga's expression shifts - wonder, then tears.
Nick: "Olga? What's happening?"
Olga: voice thick with emotion "He's... he's saying hello. He's... everywhere. I can feel... oh..." overwhelmed
An Var: gently to the others "Would you like to experience this too?"

Peijin: "Me too." steps forward without hesitation
An Var: smiles knowingly "Female energy-dominant beings are often braver in areas of calculable risk."
Peijin: to the air, to everything "Kho Pa, yes. I give you permission. Please, speak with me."
Another pause. Peijin gasps softly, hand to heart.
Peijin: whispering "Oh... oh, this is..." tears streaming "He's not just speaking... I can feel what he feels. Being... everything. All at once. The joy of it..."
Olga and Peijin look at each other, both crying, both laughing.
Nick: to Chen, uncertain "Should we...?"
Chen: watching the two of them, wrestling with fear and desire "I... I don't know if I'm ready."
Ya Sha: "That's perfectly fine. Kho Pa understands. He can wait. He has all the time."
An Var: to Nick and Chen "There's no rush. You can speak with him whenever you feel ready. He's not going anywhere." gentle laugh "He's everywhere."

Peijin: "Me too." steps forward without hesitation
Peijin: to the air, to everything "Kho Pa, yes. I give you permission. Please, speak with me."
Kho Pa's presence enters - gentle but vast
Kho Pa: through consciousness "I guess it will be TOO MUCH for you, but we'll tone it down to 'whispers.'"
And in the very same moment, Peijin also perceives thoughts - not from Kho Pa, but from An Var standing nearby, smiling:
"Female energy-dominant beings are often braver in areas of calculable risk."
Peijin gasps - overwhelmed but exhilarated.
Peijin: out loud, to the group "I can... I can hear Kho Pa AND I just heard... An Var, you were thinking about—" laughs in wonder "—about female energy and bravery!"
An Var: delighted "Yes! You're picking up thoughts now! Kho Pa's presence opened that capacity in you temporarily."
Olga: excited "That happened to me too! I could suddenly sense... more. Not just Kho Pa, but everything around me became... louder? Clearer?"
Ya Sha: "When you connect with someone who is everywhere, you connect with everything. For a moment."
Peijin: still processing, tears of joy "This is... this is what it's like for you all the time?"
An Var: "Something like this, yes. We're always... connected."
