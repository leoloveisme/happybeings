On planet XYZ

  

Beings on planet XYZ don’t wear clothes. 

They have bodies of all possible colors and in various shapes and forms. 

  

How do you warm yourself up?

We are adapted to the chill, wind, rain, etc.

    • Can you speak?
    • Yes, we can speak, however because we communicate mostly telepathically, there is no need for us to speak.
    • Do you understand what I’m thinking now?
    • Yes, I, we do.

Because we are in the constant conscious presence and we live a conscious life we don’t need to meditate, unless we want to create something, which needs the power of many of us at the same time, additionally to the power of our planet(s), which is also us, then we collectively meditate something into existence.

  
    • Energy is all around us, everything is energy.
    • Yes, we know that already and we have a healer amongst us, who can see and feel energies, to the degree which other of us cannot do.
    • I guess it is her.
    • Yes, you’re right.

    • Do you have any kind of entertainment?
    • Yes, we have choreoyogic dances.
    • Oh, we have them as well. :)
    • And we love to solve mental tasks.

We don’t have any taboos in our society. In our society everything is allowed, which is based on love and all our actions and everything in our “society” is based on love.

  

We don’t eat

We don’t drink

We don’t sleep

Should we decide to live our whole life in the “human” form, when the time to leave the current body comes, we transcend into the energy of our planet(s) or into anything else; depending on personal desires and personal needs. We are not obliged to be and / or stay just in one form - we can also decide to change our appearance throughout our life several times. 

  

Sometimes some of us decide to be reborn on our planet or on some other planet within or far away from our galaxy.

  

We all are equal: starting from any child and the oldest of the old.

  

We preserve our knowledge, which is accessible by anyone at any given time.

  

It is in the information field all around us.

  

Can a “soul” (energy of a being) be lost? Can a soul be lost if a soul from the planet XYZ decides to be reborn / reincarnated on some other planet outside of XYZ planet’s galaxy? Can the contact with this soul be lost?

  

Yes, it happens sometimes, however the energy of the soul is permanent and eventually this energy will find the way back home, whichever location it chooses as home and the soul will be reincarnated back into being - being whatever it wants to be.

  

And yes, sometimes it is difficult even for us to recognise each other after some many transformations in various beings and various universes. 

And when we recognise each other we rejoice in joy and happiness, because we met someone we’ve already known for some many “years” and if we do not recognise each other - we rejoice in joy and happiness, because it is a starting point of us becoming one.
