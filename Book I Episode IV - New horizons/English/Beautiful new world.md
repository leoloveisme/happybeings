On planet XYZ

  

Beings on planet XYZ don’t wear clothes. 

They have bodies of all possible colors and in various shapes and forms. 

  

How do you warm yourself up?

We are adapted to the chill, wind, rain, etc.

    • Can you speak?
    • Yes, we can speak, however because we communicate mostly telepathically, there is no need for us to speak.
    • Do you understand what I’m thinking now?
    • Yes, I, we do.


We don't meditate, because we're always conscious. 

We are in the constant conscious presence and we live a conscious life that's the reason / why we don’t meditate, unless we want to create something, then meditate something into existence using the all power around us: the power of our planet, our moons and sometimes, though very rarely, even the power or neighbouring planets.  

  
    • Energy is all around us, everything is energy.
    • Yes, we know that already and we have a healer amongst us, who can see and feel energies, to the degree which other of us cannot do.
    • It is this being there. 
    • Yes, you’re right.

    • Do you have any kind of entertainment?
    • Yes, we have choreoyogic dances.
    • Oh, we have them as well. :)
    • And we love to solve mental tasks.


We don’t have any taboos in our society. In our society everything is allowed, which is based on love and all our actions and everything in our “society” is based on love.

We don’t eat

We don’t drink

We don’t sleep

We hardly ever speak, because so much can get lost in the spoken communication, but we laugh a lot and often. We speak, when we cannot communicate telepathically and usually we do that with telepathy-receiving-impaired beings from other world / universes. Such beings are very rare, however they exist. Mostly it is curable, however we usually don't cure any beings, unless it is involuntary death situation and the mentally unconscious being is injured and / or needs to be saved. We can read even from mentally unconscious mind, unless it is actively blocked. Yes, some beings can do that, even when they are mentally unconscious.

All experiences are "automatically" (we don't have any machines for that) shared and saved into our conscious energy space.



Years of our lives could be roughly divided into the following approximate structures:
  

0 - 200 - childhood (time of observation and evaluating information)

200 - 400 - youth (time of experiments and trying out)

400 - 600 - adulthood (time of being and enjoyment)

600 - 800 - aging ()

800 - 1000 - old age ()


Of course this structure is very approximate as everything is very individual and depends from many factors: as in what shape or form does a being want to live on the planet XYZ


and

  

Should we decide to live our whole life in the “human” form, when the time to leave the current body comes, because one or another decided so, we also can live in the chosen form eternally, we transcend into the energy of our planet(s) or into anything else; depending on personal desires and personal needs. We are not obliged to be and / or stay just in one form - we can also decide to change our appearance throughout our life several times. 

Even if we "die" we don't die, we just change. To be reincarnated / re-born again. 
  

Sometimes some of us decide to be reborn on our planet or on some other planet within or far away from our galaxy.

  

We all are equal: starting from any child and the oldest of the old.

  

We preserve our knowledge, which is accessible by anyone at any given time.

  

It is in the information field all around us.

  

Can a “soul” (energy of a being) be lost? Can a soul be lost if a soul from the planet XYZ decides to be reborn / reincarnated on some other planet outside of XYZ planet’s galaxy? Can the contact with this soul be lost?

  

Yes, it happens sometimes, however the energy of the soul is permanent and eventually this energy will find the way back home, whichever location it chooses as home and the soul will be reincarnated back into being - being whatever it wants to be.

  

And yes, sometimes it is difficult even for us to recognise each other after some many transformations in various beings and various universes. 

And when we recognise each other we rejoice in joy and happiness, because we met someone we’ve already known for some many “years” and if we do not recognise each other - we rejoice in joy and happiness, because it is a starting point of us becoming one.

Beings on the planet could take literally any appearance. They could be trees, stones, water that flows on the planet and even air and they could literally be any moving and breathing being.
