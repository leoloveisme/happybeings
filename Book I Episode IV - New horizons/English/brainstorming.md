Non-organic robots with 8 hands-legs: 

Quirong like **qui**ck & st**rong** will stay on the planet XYZ and become XYZ-tian i.e. free XYZ being and will be known as Stro So Fle. 

and 

Robo, who will stay with the crew and will create another robot for the flight back from the parts, which were actually enough to create 5 more similar robots.

The robots don't have a front or a back. The front can become the back within a second - the robot just needs to turn the head and hands-legs.

The child will go to Earth with Chen Marc and Olga Ahlam. (?)

Even as a child it possesses a whole lot of knowledge of the XYZ universe, because it is in an ever existing connection with the XYZ universe.
The child will become the catalyst of even more radical positive changes on Earth üåç üåé and in the Milky Way universe.

If one doesn‚Äôt see something, it doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean that it is not there; maybe you simply cannot see it yet. And once you can see it, you can see it. It is like with walking, once you can walk - you can walk.
