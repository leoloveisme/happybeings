# Life of conscious choice(s)

There is always something going on, it's just a matter of where exactly do you direct your attention to; then everything is communicating: the trees, the mushrooms, the bugs, the birds; everything communicates, speaks, sings, makes music and everything is recorded into energy. If you stop and learn how to be present in this very moment now and here, here and now and learn to listen and understand what’s going on in the world around you, you’ll see everything through the eyes of the universe. 

All in life is happening for you, happens for you and will happen for you - you just need to appreciate it.

We can choose the lives we want to live and in what shape, form and / or being. 

We can decide to live one of our lives as a tree or as a fish or a bird or as a bug or as a ant. 
We can change as many times as we want to. And sometimes some of us decide to live life as only one form of being.

 We literally are all interconnected. 

To form a mountain many beings are needed and these beings form a mountain. 

Sometimes one (or several) of the beings “breaks away” from the mountain and it has an effect on the mountain and the surroundings. The same applies to the seas and the oceans. 

Our whole planet is a living being, comprised of many various individual beings and together we create harmony and live in it.

  

Q: How much time do you take for decision making?

A: All the time we need - all the time of eternity. 


  
Life as is. 


*******************

Peijin, Jon, Nick, Amalia and Ya Sha. 


We are the ones of the few, who were not corrected and screened during the conception and our genes were not manipulated and / or improved. We are the children of the natural conception and natural pregnancy by our biological mothers. 

We are not so called designed children. 

Did I want to change? I don't know anymore. I don't think so. I know that I'm unique as I am and I celebrate my uniqueness and I'm sure that Peijin also does that. 

"Yes, I do" confirmed Peijin.

There is no longer fear of the different on the Earth. There are many different life forms on Earth nowadays. Natural beings, artificially created beings, cyborgs, robots, etc and we all live in peace loving and appreciating each other. 

We celebrate "things", we celebrate uniqueness, we celebrate similarity, we celebrate being alive, WE CELEBRATE. 

Should I want to change the way I look I can do that. Thankfully the technologies allow us to do that. 

"Do you want to change Ya (Sha)?" asked Nick. 

"I haven't decided yet. I'm still gathering information and I'm also starting to try things out."

"Do you enjoy being you?"

Yes, I do. I enjoy being me as I am now and my brother decided to live the live in the form he has chosen.

Can he change the form, whenever he wants to? 

Of course he can. We can be whatever / whoever we want to be and we don't need any technical devices for that. 

"Where is he now?"

"He is here." and she made a gesture encompassing all space around them.  

How about travelling? 

Oh, we can travel, too, however we usually don't do that. We have everything we need on our planet and we can transfer ourselves to any location we want to on our planet or onto any other planet of our choice. We just need to "see" where we want to "go" and we "go" there.
