Book I - Episode III





Introduction

This is the book about universes without money and at this place you actually could close the book, because it is really what in the essence the book is about or you can keep reading about the characters and their journeys in this universes as the saga tells some stories about various humans and other wonderful beings.
Some of the characters of the story are an intersex being, an artificially created / grown female being with enhanced features and capabilities, a gorgeous and stunningly beautiful transwoman and absolutely “norlmal” male being, an older male, a child, two lovers and other wonderful beings of all possible body types and colours. There are blue beings and yellow beings in the story, a blue moon and an orange moon, vast cosmos with it’s endless stars.
The main objective of the book is to show you as a reader that living a free life in the world, where you currently live is not only, but absolutely possible and hopefully you can read in the book how you, yes you, who is reading this book, now can come to such a (way of) living, too.

We are still in space.
If the planet wouldn’t be more colorful and it didn’t have two moons: a bule and an orange one we could’ve confused it for Earth. And at some rare occasions these moons might change their colors to: yellow, red and green and brown. 
Soon we’ll land on the planet, where many years ago we, Earthlings sent another spaceship, which was loaded with robots and a couple of cyborgs and androids. 
The spaceship did an initial contact in which they sent a message of a successful landing, that the planet is suitable for living: it has breathable oxygen and the gravity which is very close to the one on Earth and it was the one and only message we received. 
After that the communication ceased to exist. 
None of the robots and the spaceship became unresponsive. 
Our team is supposed to clarify what has happened to the spaceship and to the crew.
Pretty soon we will be landing on this beautiful colorful planet and hopefully we’ll get to understand what has happened to the previous spaceship.

On planet XYZ

People on planet XYZ don’t wear clothes. 
They have bodies of all possible colors and various shapes and forms. 

How do you warm yourself up?
We are adapted to the chill, wind, rain, etc.

    • Can you speak?
    • Yes, we can speak, however because we communicate mostly telepathically, there is no need for us to speak.
    • Do you understand what I’m thinking now?
    • Yes, I, we do.

Because we are in the constant presence and we live a conscious life we don’t need to meditate, unless we want to create something, which needs the power of many of us at the same time, additionally to the power of our planet(s), then we collectively meditate something into existence.

    • Energy is all around us, everything is energy.
    • Yes, we know that already and we have a healer amongst us, who can see and feel energies, to the degree which other of us cannot do.
    • I guess it is her.
    • Yes, you’re right.

    • Do you have any kind of entertainment?
    • Yes, we have choreoyogic dances.
    • Oh, we have them as well. :)
    • And we love to solve mental tasks.

We don’t have any taboos in our society. In our society everything is allowed. All our actions and everything in our society is based on love.

We don’t eat
We don’t drink
We don’t sleep

0 - 200 - childhood
200 - 400 - youth
400 - 600 - adulthood
600 - 800 - aging
800 - 1000 - old age
and
When the time to leave the current body comes, we transcend into the energy of our planet(s) or into anything else; depending on personal desires and personal needs.

Sometimes some of us decide to be reborn on our planet or on some other planet within or far away from our galaxy.

We all are equal: starting from any child and the oldest of the old.

We preserve our knowledge, which is accessible by anyone at any given time.

It is in the information field all around us.

Can a “soul” (energy of a being) be lost? Can a soul be lost if a soul from the planet XYZ decides to be reborn / reincarnated on some other planet outside of XYZ planet’s galaxy? Can the contact with this soul be lost?

Back to Earth:

It was actually a late afternoon and Il’ya was walking, or actually he was running and stopping, jumping and leaping and stopping to appreciate and admire a flower or a butterfly on the way to the House of meetings. 
It was a warm summer day here in what once called “” and he became thirsty. He went to the nearest creek, which was flowing near the footpath, folded his palms and scooped some water from the creek and drank. He scooped some water again and drank again. He did it a couple of times and then he advanced towards the House of meetings. There he hopped to meet his uncle, who very soon will fly to the mysterious planet XYZ. He knew that his mother and all his four sisters would also be there. He was the second child after his older sister. 

“Shall I bring you something from the planet, rather than the usual?” asked Chen, when they were working back to their premises from the House of meetings , thankfully they lived quite close to each other. 
“No, the usual, will do.” answered Il’ya.
They were talking about the stars, about how beautiful and wonderful Earth is and about many other various things and matters.
Tomorrow Chen and his teammates will depart for XYZ and the time spent with his nephew and his nieces and other relatives was a gift, which he enjoyed fully and thoroughly.

See in the past people manufactured stuff in the hope that it will be used by people and it was an absolute madness. Nowadays we have manufacturing strictly on demand and all our manufacturing is needs based.

Two civilisations living on Earth:

People living in the cities and people living in small communities away from the cities with two quite different approaches to life, however both with an enormous respect for the planet, it’s nature and each other. 

Technocratic and natural spiritual civilisations.


Helmets for accessing and working with information at schools and special devices which work in the way that beings have learned to work with information using these special non-invasive devices, which can be worn on the body as a bracelet or medallion or something else of that kind. These devices are capable of holographic telepresence and many other functions.
One can easily locate the devices and the person wearing them. Should the device somehow get lost it can be easily found. 



There is always something going on, it's just a matter of where exactly do you direct your attention to; then everything is communicating: the trees, the mushrooms, the bugs, the birds; everything communicates, speaks, sings, makes music.
