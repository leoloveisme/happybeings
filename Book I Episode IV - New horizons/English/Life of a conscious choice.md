# Life of a conscious choice

There is always something going on, it's just a matter of where exactly do you direct your attention to; then everything is communicating: the trees, the mushrooms, the bugs, the birds; everything communicates, speaks, sings, makes music and everything is recorded into energy. If you stop and learn how to be present in this very moment now and here, here and now and learn to listen and understand what’s going on in the world around you, you’ll see everything through the eyes of the universe. 

All in life is happening for you, happens for you and will happen for you - you just need to appreciate it.

  

We can choose the lives we want to live and in what shape, form and / or being. 

We can decide to live one of our lives as a tree or as a fish or a bird or as a bug or as a colony of ants. And sometimes some of us decide to live life as only one form of being.

  

To form a mountain many beings are needed and these beings form a mountain. 

Sometimes one (or several) of the beings “breaks away” from the mountain and it has an effect on the mountain and the surroundings. The same applies to the seas and the oceans. 

Our whole planet is a living being, comprised of many various individual beings and together we create harmony and live in it.

  

Q: How much time do you take for decision making?

A: All the time we need - all the time of eternity. 

  

If one doesn’t see something, it doesn’t necessarily mean that it is not there; maybe you simply cannot see it yet. And once you can see it, you can see it. It is like with walking, once you can walk - you can walk.
