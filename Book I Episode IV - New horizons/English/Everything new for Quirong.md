# Everything new for Quirong

Quirong you know that you have to be deconstructed to become one of us. Are you sure that you want to do that? asked Ya (Sha). Because only once dissolves oneself in everything, one becomes everything. 
"Absolutely." answered Quirong. "I do."
"Do you know in what kind of shape do you want to be once the deconstruction is completed?"
"I'll be me, i.e. in my shape and form, however I'll be both strong, soft and flexible and I want to have the same organic brain like you have Ya  and be organic, like the majourity of you ones, who move as quickly as some gentle winds" answered Quirong "and I'll have a new name. I'll be Str (pronounced "styr") So Fle" he said.
