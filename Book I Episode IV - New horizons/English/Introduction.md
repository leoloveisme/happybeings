# Introduction

This is the book about universes without money and at this place you actually could close the book, because it is really what in the essence the book is about or you can keep reading about the characters and their journeys in this universes as the saga tells some stories about various humans and other wonderful beings.

Some of the characters of the story are an intersex being, an artificially created / grown female being with enhanced features and capabilities, a gorgeous and stunningly beautiful transwoman and absolutely “norlmal” male being, an older male, a child, two lovers and other wonderful beings of all possible body types and colours. There are blue beings and yellow beings in the story, a blue moon and an orange moon, vast cosmos with it’s endless stars.

The main objective of the book is to show you as a reader that living a free life in the world, where you currently live is not only, but absolutely possible and hopefully you can read in the book how you, yes you, who is reading this book, now can come to such a (way of) living, too.
