# Introduction

This is the book about universes without money and at this place you actually could close the book, because it is really what in the essence the book is about or you can keep reading about the characters and their journeys in these universes as the saga tells some stories about several various wonderful beings.

Some of the characters of the story are: an intersex being, an artificially created / grown female being with enhanced features and capabilities, a gorgeous and stunningly beautiful transwoman and absolutely “normal” male being, an older male, a "child", several lovers and other wonderful beings of all possible body types and colours. There are blue beings, yellow and multicoloured beings in the story, a blue moon and an orange moon, which change their colours and vast cosmos with it’s endless stars and universes.

The main objective of the book is to show you as a reader that living a free and happy life in the world where money doesn't exist even as a term is not only, but absolutely possible and hopefully you can read in the book how you, yes you - who is reading this book, can come to such a (way of) living, too.
