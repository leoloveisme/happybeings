# Enjoying being

An Var and Sai Ya


were young adults they went through the periods of time of observation and evaluation of information (childhood) and time of experiments and trying out (youth)

and were in the time of just being and enjoying each other and the others, enjoying being together and with the others 

They were enjoying

It was a(nother) great evening. Every evening on XYZ is great. And they were playing. They were running and kissing and hugging and running again. 

They enjoyed their planet and both moons of the planet. (The blue and the orange one, which would change colours and become the blue one -> green and the orange one -> yellow or red) 

Some beings would change the colours of their skin to match the planet's moons colours and would become orange and blue, yellow and blue, yellow and green, blue and red, etc

Now they run to the sea to take a swim and have sex there.
