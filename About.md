The book / screenplay is about universes where money doesn't exist even as a term

Steps needed for change:

All sentient beings need to:
 
+ start caring about each other 
+ have collective good and wellbeing as long as oneâ€™s own in mind, if possible at all time or at least as much as possible
+ collaborate with each other on (crucial) tasks (at hand) without expectation of any reward(s)
+ strive perfection for oneself and everything and everyone around
