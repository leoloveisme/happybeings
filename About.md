The book / screenplay is about universes where money doesn't exist even as a term.

The objective of the book(s) to show that happy life without money is not only possible but absolutely possible.

Steps needed for change:

All sentient beings need to:
 
+ start caring about each other 
+ have collective good and wellbeing on mind as much as possible
+ collaborate & cooperate with each other on (crucial) tasks (at hand) without expectation of any reward(s)
+ strive perfection for oneself and everything and everyone around 

Are worlds without money possible?
What, in your opinion, shall be done, to get there?

We need to get rid of greed, violence, envy, jealousy.
