The book / screenplay is about universes where money doesn't exist even as a term

Steps needed for change:

All sentient beings need to:
 
+ start caring about each other 
+ have collective good and wellbeing on mind as much as possible
+ collaborate with each other on (crucial) tasks (at hand) without expectation of any reward(s)
+ strive perfection for oneself and everything and everyone around 

Are worlds without money possible?
What, in your opinion, shall be done, to get there?

We need to get rid of greed, violence, envy, jealousy. 

The story / stories has / have to be structured that way that the reader(s) will see that the immigration to other planets alone will not change anything if the current systems based on money and reward system are still intact. 

Side note:

There will be a lot of nudity in the book(s) and in the film.

People are originally from Mars. 

There was a civilisation on the Mars, which also was based on money and lead to the planet to become inhabitable i.e. not suitable for living anymore. 

People were moved to Mars, where they proceed to live the life style and the societal systems they knew and had on Mars.

Money? What is money?
Even though some previous generations on Earth used money in the past, now money was absolutely forgotten. 
And what was forgotten - disappears once and sometimes forever. 


House of meetings / House of knowledge - is the same place, where people meet to exchange ideas and learn from / teach each other. 

Side note: 

If the underlying systems will not change, the escape to Mars will not change anything; it will just prolong the “agony” of the current lifestyle, which in itself, some might argue is not too bad as the won time might yield the opportunity for the society on the other planet to heal and change.
