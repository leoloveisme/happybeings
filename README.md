The moment we learn to create, co-create and cooperate without (even an expectation of) any reward(s) we'll (make a) leap into a new reality.

I used to have a link to a co-writing space on Google Drive here, which I took down now to avoid very different content versions. 

Please use this resource for contributing and co-creating.

For brainstorming and ideas exchange please use the brainstorming document(s)

********************

This is a project for the book / screenplay series called **Happy Beings**. 

Feel free to translate this book(s) into other languages and contribute in the existing ones. 

Feel free to fork or branch the story to / of your liking and if you are happy to just simply contribute, then by all means just contribute. 

The project is a FREE, OPEN, non commercial, not for profit!

Should you decide to contribute in / to the project, you will NOT receive ANY reward(s)!

It would be ideal, if we could win some intersex and queer writers for the project, as well. 

Should you decide to contribute to the project and bring an active team of writers, videographers, designers, etc - please feel free to ask for a separate branch of the project, if you want to.

The project can be multi-branching with various beginnings and various endings, pretty much like life itself. 

It just HAS TO BE about living on planet(s) where money doesn't exists and / or universes without money.

The stories can be expanded into a multitude of various possibilities and ways. 

Feel free to introduce new characters into the branches of the book.

The objective of the book(s) is to show that a happy life without money is not only possible but absolutely possible 
and 
“move” / motivate people towards the change and desired outcome (which is a free, prosperous and fulfilling life without money on various planets and in various universes). 

*********

Change management framework for the current project:

1. write an amazing book / screenplay
2. make an amazing film based on the book
3. get people (excited) to propagate the ideas from the book
4. make the ideas from the book the new normal (create a new model which will make older models obsolete)
