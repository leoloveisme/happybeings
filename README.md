********************

This is a project for the book / screenplay series called Happy People. 

So far there are planned only two versions of the books:

Russian and English one

Feel free to translate into other languages and contribute in the existing ones. 

Feel free to fork or branch the story to your liking and if you are happy to just simply contribute, then by all means just contribute. 

The project is a FREE OPEN non commercial not for profit project!

Should you decide to contribute in / to the project, you will NOT receive ANY reward(s)!

It would be ideal if we could win some intersex and queer writers for the project, as well. 

The objective of the book(s) is to show that a happy life without money is not only possible but absolutely possible 
and 
“move” / motivate people towards the change and desired outcome (which is a prosperous and fulfilling life without money on various planets and in various universes). 

Change management:

1. write an amazing book / screenplay
2. make an amazing film based on the book
3. get people propagate the ideas from the book
4. make the ideas from the book the new normal (create a new model which will make older models obsolete)
