ETs as creators and observers 

Extraordinary people who had no deeper connection (deep connected roots to the planet) to Earth and were ready to progress to some higher dimensions were transported to planet XYZ, where they would form a new civilisation, simply because it is easy to do within a(ny) given simulation (easy to transport anyone anywhere within the simulation / skipping dimensions of the simulations / raising beings into higher simulations)

and because they could run unlimited amount of controlled and uncontrolled civilizations and was like a scientific experiments for them, which were playfully done and could be done any time

********************

Naturally born harmonisers - beings who bring harmony on the planet(s)

- conscious harmonisers
- unconscious harmonisers

who are aware of their gifts and those who are initially unaware and become aware and whose who never become aware (and nevertheless do some good for the simulation they are currently are)

Transurfing simulations 
Raising into the higher simulations the whole "civilizations" by effort of the (human) beings 

When a civilization "passes the test" they can be raised into the higher simulation (like levels in games) and degrade into the lower simulations if the tests are not passed or even a termination of a simulation.
