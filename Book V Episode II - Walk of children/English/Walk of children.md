# Walk of children

The best way to deal with bullies is love and children are capable of giving love unconditionally. 
Thatâ€™s why one of the newly created free and prosperous cities was under the threat of an intermittent attack, children of this city went out towards the soldiers who were sent there by the still existing ruling elites and won them over with love and kindness.
I know it is very idealistic, however this was what came to me at the time when I wrote this.
I'm not sure it would work on narcisistic beings in the light of new evidence I acquirred relatively recently.
