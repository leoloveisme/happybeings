I had to work hard to get all this wealth and I'm not going to give it all up, just because you a bunch of hippies and communists want to eliminate money (and make everyone misserable, including me) - some millionaire 
We never had prosperity and now when we've seen some signs of possible prosperity - we're not going to give up money - "some third world population"

I don't care about the planet - what matters I live my extremely well (some hedonist - psychopat)

I guess the live can be OK without money - this some millionaire

They are doing it for their own benefits. They push their own agenda. They will fuck everything up. Everything will break irreparebly.
