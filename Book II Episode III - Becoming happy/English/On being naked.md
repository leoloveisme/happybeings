It obviously benefitial to clothe oneself in the harsh climates, simply because of the mental energy preservation.

Less clothig means less waste of resources. 

and clothes like pretty much anything can be created on demand. 

and in space it makes sense to be clothed as well because this way there is less dust within the spaceship 

Air filtration systems and cleaning robots keeping the spaceship clean. 

There are also other life enabling systems on and in spaceship.
