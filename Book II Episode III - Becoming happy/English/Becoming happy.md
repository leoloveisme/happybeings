# Becoming happy

The Earth population was on the edge of getting extinct. Earthlings were able to escape the extinction and it has started with a group of enthusiasts, who believed that they can change the world and no they didn’t do it, however they started and catalysed the needed changes, which were so very much needed. 
They started by building a free open source city in Africa which turned out to become free prosperous open source cities in various parts of the planet: in Antarctica and Siberia, Alaska and Canada, South America, New Zealand and Australia and in the, at the time, deserts of our planet in Africa, China and other parts of Earth.
These people consolidated the knowledge about the planning, building and other aspects of the city planning and building for various climates and climates zones. 
They used the principles of permaculture along with the technological advancements, which were in harmony and unison with nature.

****************

Slowly but surely we got to live on our planet in the conditions which were described in the books as paradise. 

We started to build new free cities all around the world, enclosing the parts of the old cities, which could be utilized and keeping some parts of the older cities as museums and exhibitions. 

First we built a city in Africa, then in Canada’s north, then in south America and all this without destruction of nature and rather enclosing and encompassing it.

People would talk about these new free cities and would come to live in them and contribute to them and of course people would plan and build the new ones, using technologies and best known methods available.
We also addressed the psychological aspects of living peacefully and full of love for each other and all other beings, living on our planet. 

All water which flows or is in the cities is of drinking quality, which means you can drink from any water source in the city, which is located under the open skies.

Free open source structures and places for living* are duplicated all over Earth

Freedom on Earth

* as opposed to cities, settlements, villages, etc

I don't know much about ants, however we could be similar to ants, where every single one of them is doing what it has to do and if there is / are some big(ger) project(s) they get together to take care of this / these project(s) and once it is done, they disperse again to the tasks they were doing before or to any other task(s).

When our basic needs are met we cancentrate on doing what we want to do / meant to be doing and the sense of collectivism, when it comes to the tasks, which benefit the whole society, then the bundelling of energy and effort(s) has to happen naturally and organically. 

Helping each other has to be our other inate quality along with altruism, however the latter one is self-explanatory common sense in a conscious society in a society of conscious beings. 

When we are doing what we want to be doing at the location where we want to do it and at the time we want to do it, we look to the side only for getting something additional(ly) / some additional aspiration / inspiration which would benefit our creative creation process (and absolutely not because of envy, because what envy is we have mostly already forgotten)

and 

for our own projects there is absolutely no pressure to finish anything at all, we can wonderfully create just for the creation sake, as a creative outlet of our creativity and if we happen to finish something, we celebrate it even more, however what is completion, what is and when is something really finished / completed / considered being finished / completed.
 
Perfection doesn't have any boundaries and something what was apparently completed / finished (suddenly) can become work in progress again, if the creator decides so.
 
Original work shouldn't be touched by others, however copying something and improving the copied, is encouraged, if you for yourself decide that you can do something even better, than how it was done by the original creator(s), then there is nothing in your way to improve something, then perfection doesn't have any boundaries and doesn't have any limits. 

Incremental improvements...

Creation for creation sake is very ok. 

Jumping from one personal project to another personal project is a coplete normality, as well. 

Where there is no pressure, there are no diamonds :)) and what is a diamond? / what are diamonds? just another form of a commonly available material.
