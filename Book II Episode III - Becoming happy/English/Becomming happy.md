## Becoming happy
### Book II Episode III



The Earth population was on the edge of getting extinct. Earthlings were able to escape the extinction and it has started with a group of enthusiasts, who believed that they can change the world and no they didn’t do it, however they started and catalysed the needed changes, which were so very much needed. 
They started by building a free open source city in Africa which turned out to become free prosperous open source cities in various parts of the planet: in Antarctica and Siberia, Alaska and Canada, South America, New Zealand and Australia and in the, at the time, deserts of our planet in Africa, China and other parts of Earth.
These people consolidated the knowledge about the planning, building and other aspects of the city planning and building for various climates and climates zones. 
They used the principles of permaculture along with technological advancements, which were in harmony and unison with nature.

# Culture

Cooperate without any reward
Cooperate (even) without (any expectation of) any reward
Cooperate for the sake of life itself

Create without any reward
Create for the joy of creation

and all that following the permaculture principles

# Religion

There is no religion; just love and sincere caring for each other.

# Sex & sexuality

Naked body, nudity, sex, sexuality, gender and choice of personal identity are absolutely free from taboos and are at each being’s personal discretion and can be change at any given time, again at each being’s personal discretion. The clothes are still worn by some people, especially living in the coldest climate zones, however the majority of people are just naked most of the time. 

Polyamory, polygamy, polyfidelity all kind of relationships are accepted and happen on a voluntarily and consensus basis amongst all involved beings.
Bearing children is no longer a priority as children can be designed and born artificially unless some beings decide to bear children naturally and some beings decide to be artificially fertilized and care out their children naturally. Children can be simply designed and later as they are “born”, they are “adopted” by their parents, who have “ordered” and designed them.
Children can be “produced” to the desired age. Should the “parents” change their mind the “born” child will live in a Love home until it decides it’s purpose.
The live has become pro-choice at all times amongst all beings on the planet long time ago.
Artificially created genderless children / beings, later can decide what gender they want to become, should they want to become any gender. Some also may want to stay their whole life genderless. And that is absolutely OK, too.

****************

Slowly but surely we got to live on our planet like it was described in the books as paradise. 

We started to build new cities all around the world, enclosing the parts of the old cities, which could be utilized and keeping some parts of the older cities as museums and exhibitions. 

First we built a city in Africa, then in Canada’s north, then in south America and all this without destruction of nature and rather enclosing and encompassing it.

People would talk about these new cities and would come to live and contribute to them and of course people would plan and build the new ones using technologies and best known methods available.
We also addressed the psychological aspects of living peacefully and full of love for each other and all other beings, living on our planet. 

All water which flows or is in the city is of drinking quality, which means you can drink from any water source in the city, which is located under the open skies.

*************

Free open source structures for living* are duplicated all over Earth
Freedom on Earth

* as opposed to cities, settlements, villages, etc
