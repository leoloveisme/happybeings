# Becoming happy

The Earth population was on the edge of getting extinct. Earthlings were able to escape the extinction and it has started with a group of enthusiasts, who believed that they can change the world and no they didn’t do it, however they started and catalysed the needed changes, which were so very much needed. 
They started by building a free open source city in Africa which turned out to become free prosperous open source cities in various parts of the planet: in Antarctica and Siberia, Alaska and Canada, South America, New Zealand and Australia and in the, at the time, deserts of our planet in Africa, China and other parts of Earth.
These people consolidated the knowledge about the planning, building and other aspects of the city planning and building for various climates and climates zones. 
They used the principles of permaculture along with technological advancements, which were in harmony and unison with nature.

****************

Slowly but surely we got to live on our planet like it was described in the books as paradise. 

We started to build new free cities all around the world, enclosing the parts of the old cities, which could be utilized and keeping some parts of the older cities as museums and exhibitions. 

First we built a city in Africa, then in Canada’s north, then in south America and all this without destruction of nature and rather enclosing and encompassing it.

People would talk about these new free cities and would come to live and contribute to them and of course people would plan and build the new ones using technologies and best known methods available.
We also addressed the psychological aspects of living peacefully and full of love for each other and all other beings, living on our planet. 

All water which flows or is in the cities is of drinking quality, which means you can drink from any water source in the city, which is located under the open skies.

Free open source structures for living* are duplicated all over Earth
