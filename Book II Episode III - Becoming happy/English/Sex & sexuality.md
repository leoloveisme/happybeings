# Sex & sexuality

Naked body, nudity, sex, sexuality, gender and choice of personal identity are absolutely free from taboos and are at each being’s personal discretion and can be changed at any given time again at each being’s personal discretion. The clothes are still worn by some people, especially living in the coldest climate zones, however the majority of people are just naked most of the time.

Polyamory, polygamy, polyfidelity all kind of relationships are accepted and happen on a voluntarily and consensus basis amongst all involved beings.
Bearing children is no longer a priority as children can be designed and born artificially unless some beings decide to bear children naturally and some beings decide to be artificially fertilized and care out their children naturally. Children can be simply designed and later as they are “born”, they are “adopted” by their parents or community, who have “ordered” and designed them.
Children can be “produced” to the desired age. Should the “parents” change their mind abount wanting to be(come) "parents" or gardians the “born” child will live in a community until the child decides it’s purpose in life.
The live has become pro-choice at all times amongst all beings on the planet long time ago.
There are also artificially created genderless children / beings, who later can decide what gender they want to become, should they want to become any gender. Some also may want to stay their whole life genderless. And that is absolutely OK, too.
