Cooperate without any reward
Cooperate (even) without (any expectation of) any reward
Cooperate for the sake of life itself

Create, co-create and cooperate without any reward
Create and co-create for the joy of creation
Cooperate for the joy of cooperation

and all that following the permaculture principles
