# Two civilisations on Earth

There are currently two civilisations living on Earth:

Technocratic and natural spiritual civilisations:
  
People living in the cities and people living in small communities away from the cities with two quite different approaches to life, however both of these civilisations live with an enormous respect for the planet, itâ€™s nature and each other.
